# Scope 

Ideally I want to create a cover letter generator for most of your day to day needs. I do not expect that the cover letter generator will get you 100% of the way there and you can use this for each job application without going through it. I highly advise reading through what is generated and tailoring it for the specific job you are applying to. However, that being said I also realize that creating a cover letter for every job posting out there is incredibly time consuming and very much a pain in the ass. 

Thus I want to create an application that is in the middle ground. It will save you time starting from scratch and you can do the final polish before submitting it. 

I cannot guarantee that it will help you with getting a job but I can guarantee that it will get you part of the way there.
