# CovGen

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Motivation 

Just a simple project I wanted to make using Angular Material Library for quick bootstrapping. This application generates a cover letter for you. 

## Features I want to add 

Right now the application is super specific to me and only allows customizablity for a few fields. I want to add more strings for each of the different paragraphs and perhaps add a element of randomness so that whatever is generated by the project is not so random. Am also planning on making it so that the strings are loaded from JSON files which are stored so that the TS file is not so clunky.
